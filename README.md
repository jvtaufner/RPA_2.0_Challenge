# RPA_2.0_Challenge
## Instructions
Each step should be executed in order.<br>
At the end of each one, a work-item-out will be created, being the input for the next step. The third step will generate a .xlsx file, required by the challenge.<br>
The steps follow the Robocorp Robot format, so inside each of the directories is the python script for the step you are in. <br>
